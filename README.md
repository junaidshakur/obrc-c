https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc


Initial version of working file to process 1 billion records on **intel core i7 10510U** took avg **1m10.142s**

Will try further improvmement

- Try memory mapped file
- parse measurement as short/int instead of double
- after that will see if what other advace optimzation can be done to reduece time.
